specify if the amount of the kinetic reactant should be fixed to the initial amount over the simulation.
Pssible values: *true* (fixed); *false* (not fixed); default is *false*.
Fixing the amount of a kinetic reactant may be desireable when the kinetic reactant is used to represents a reaction rate that transfers mass between other reactants.
